title: Functional Analysis
index: false

This series of articles was written during my self-study of functional analysis through the **IMPA "Functional Analysis"** course. The main purpose is to organize the learned knowledge points in real-time, provide explanations for some of the exercises, and consolidate my understanding.

Since the course is entirely taught in English and uses English textbooks, I will use English for writing and organizing the notes. A Chinese version may later be generated via AI.
